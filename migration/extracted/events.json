Far from abstract philosophy, these teachings offer a radical reorientation of how we perceive ourselves and the world — pointing us beyond habitual grasping to a space of clarity, openness, and profound compassion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Having cultivated the foundational practices of shamatha and vipashyana in the first year and explored Yogācāra’s profound psychology of ignorance and awakening in the second, we now turn to the very heart of Tibetan Buddhism: the nature of emptiness and the luminous potential that resides within every living being. Guiding us in this exploration will be core texts from India and Tibet. Nāgārjuna’s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā will serve as a central pillar, systematically dismantling the illusions of inherent existence. In dialogue with this, we’ll study Kamalashīla’s Stages of Meditation, a practical and accessible map for cultivating deep meditative insight grounded in the view of emptiness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Balancing the radical freedom of Madhyamaka, we will encounter the warmth and encouragement of Maitreya’s Ratnagotravibhāga, a poetic illumination of the Buddha-nature within all beings. These teachings remind us that beyond confusion and conditioning, there is a basic goodness that has never been lost. To ground these profound insights in daily life, we will also study the beloved text of Geshe Chekawa Yeshe Dorje, The Seven Points of Mind Training. With its pithy slogans and deeply practical tone, it offers tools for transforming adversity and cultivating bodhicitta on and off the cushion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Throughout the year, our study and practice will be enriched by meditative teachings from both the Pāli and Sanskrit sūtra traditions, inviting a direct and experiential understanding of emptiness — not as a concept, but as a liberating shift in perception. This year is an invitation to let the view of emptiness infuse your practice — not as abstract philosophy, but as living experience: clear, liberating, and rooted in compassion. Our aim is not to gather concepts, but to transform how we see and relate to the world. Through study, reflection, and meditation, we learn to meet life with less grasping, more openness — and a heart that naturally responds with wisdom and care, held by the strength of community.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">The Buddha Project</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This meditation course is part of The Buddha Project led by Ven. Losang Gendun, a branch of which is the Buddha Research Project, an on-going collaboration between Buddhist contemplatives and scientific researchers from the universities of Nîmes and Lausanne, and the Mind &amp; Life organization (founded by neuroscientist Francesco Varela in collaboration with H.H. the Dalai Lama). It is aimed at investigating transformative processes in long-term meditators, regarding such topics as mental health, perception, and self-transcendence. For the initial research it has been granted a European Varela Award.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Introduction to the IDMT training</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Meditation is essential for personal transformation and a crucial complement to Buddhist studies.

The course offers a great opportunity for Buddhist practitioners. In the first year many of the foundational topics will be introduced, however a basic understanding of Mahayana Buddhism is a prerequisite to attend. It will be given in English, with French translation, online via Zoom. The recordings will be made available after the sessions.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Practical information and how to register:</strong></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Course dates:</strong> 7 Feb – 18 April</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weekday: </strong>Saturdays</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Time:</strong> 15:30-18:00 European Central Timezone</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Language:</strong> English</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Location:</strong> Online (zoom link will be sent after registration)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Donation:</strong> drop in 250 SEK, term 2500 SEK, 4 times pass 800 SEK</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Last day of registration</strong>: you can join any time</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Your Teacher</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-293321 alignleft\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Venerable-Gendun-round_Web-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />Venerable Losang Gendun has dedicated nearly four decades to practicing Buddhism and has served as a Bhikshu (Buddhist monk) in the Tibetan tradition for the past 18 years. Prior to his ordination, he worked in diverse fields such as palliative care, technology, refugee organizations, and commercial management. His extensive training includes ten years of studying Buddhist philosophy and practice in monasteries across France, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. Additionally, he spent over four years in retreat, immersing himself in Tibetan sutra and tantra, as well as the Burmese Theravada Forest Tradition. For the last 15 years, Ven. Gendun has been a dedicated teacher, sharing his knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, psychology, and meditation worldwide. He serves the aspirations of H.H. the Dalai Lama and Lama Zopa Rinpoche as part of the FPMT (Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition). Ven. Gendun is also a member of Mind &amp; Life Europe, a multidisciplinary laboratory that brings together researchers and contemplative practitioners to explore the nature of experience. Beyond his Buddhist affiliations, Ven. Gendun serves as an interreligious canon at the Peace Cathedral in Tbilisi, Georgia, and feels at home at a Mevlavi Sufi dargah in Istanbul.

Healing of the body and mind is supported by reawakening and balancing our energy. The method was created by the Tibetan lama Tarthang Tulku, primarily to help us who live a hectic life to release stress. By promoting deep relaxation, the conditions are created to naturally deepen meditative concentration and presence. Everyone can participate regardless of age and physical shape, as the exercises can be adapted to suit one&#8217;s own ability.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Course Details</h2>\n<p>🗣️ With Stig Albansson</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">📅 January 18, February 1 and 15, March 1, 15 and 29, April 12 and 19</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🕕 10:00 &#8211; 11:30</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🏠 Online</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px; color: #333333;\">About the Course</span></p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<p>Kum Nye is a gentle method that consists of movement and breathing exercises, self-massage and quiet sitting.

Rooted in the Vajrayāna’s rich lineage, this course explores the foundations of deity yoga, the stages of generation and completion, and the role of guru devotion, mantra, and visualization. We practice tantra not to escape the world, but to transmute it — recognizing all appearances as expressions of enlightened mind. It is a path of fearless compassion, unshakable clarity, and skillful means. This course is intended for those who have studied the Lam Rim, are already grounded in the sutra path and ready to deepen their understanding of Vajrayāna’s profound methods.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">In the event of any enquiries please reach out to <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"mailto:spc@yeshinnorbu.se\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">spc@yeshinnorbu.se</span></a></span>.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px; align-items: start;\">\n<div style=\"flex: 0 0 15%;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 50%; aspect-ratio: 1/1; object-fit: cover;\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Venerable-Khadro_portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Venerable Khadro\" /></div>\n<div style=\"flex: 1;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Your Teacher</h2>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Venerable Khadro brings years of experience teaching Buddhist philosophy and meditation in the tradition of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

Venerable Gendun will illuminate how kindness and compassion can be clear-eyed, grounded tools—both for spiritual development and robust engagement with a complex<br />\nworld. Drawing on the Mahayana Buddhist tradition, which reveals how our minds contain extraordinary qualities that guide us toward inner and social freedom, Venerable Gendun</p>\n<p>will share practical methods for nurturing these essential qualities. These accessible techniques can be integrated into daily life, whether navigating workplace stress, family<br />\nrelationships, or inner struggles. Everyone is welcome, regardless of background or familiarity with Buddhism. Whether you are curious about meditation, seeking greater peace of mind, or looking to deepen existing practice, this talk offers valuable guidance. No prior knowledge required.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px; align-items: start;\">\n<div style=\"flex: 1;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-293321 alignleft\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Venerable-Gendun-round_Web-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">About the Teacher</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Venerable Losang Gendun is a Dutch Buddhist teacher and monk. After practicing mainly Theravada Buddhism for twenty years, he became a monk in the Tibetan tradition in 2006. At the Nalanda monastery in France, he studied Buddhist philosophy for nine years. In all,  Venerable Gendun spent more than four years in retreat. Venerable Gendun specializes in the Tibetan Lojong and Mahamudra methods, as well as Vipassana-shamatha meditation as taught in the Theravada forest tradition. At Yeshin Norbu he also leads the In-Depth Meditation Training program online.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>",

We will journey through the four major Buddhist philosophical schools recognized in Tibetan tradition—Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, and Madhyamaka—discovering how each system progressively<br />\ndeepens our understanding of reality&#8217;s ultimate nature. Through guided meditation, contemplation, and accessible discussion, Venerable Gendun will trace the evolution from foundational views on non-self to explorations of subject- object duality and the fundamental interdependence of all phenomena, examining their psychological, social, environmental, and political consequences. The weekend culminates in Je Tsongkhapa&#8217;s distinctive Prāsaṅgika interpretation—renowned for its radical deconstruction of inherent existence while maintaining the validity of conventional reality</div>\n<h4></h4>\n<div>No philosophy degree required! We&#8217;ll translate ancient wisdom into contemporary language, using everyday examples and experiential exercises. Whether you are new to Buddhism or deepening existing practice, you will gain practical tools for understanding how things exist, transforming your relationship with anxiety, attachment, and the solidity we project onto experience. Discover how emptiness isn&#8217;t merely negation but the key to compassion, wisdom, and genuine presence in our complex modern world.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-293321 alignleft\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Venerable-Gendun-round_Web-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\"><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">About the </span><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Teacher</span></h2>\n</div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Venerable Losang Gendun is a Dutch Buddhist teacher and monk.

Far from abstract philosophy, these teachings offer a radical reorientation of how we perceive ourselves and the world — pointing us beyond habitual grasping to a space of clarity, openness, and profound compassion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Having cultivated the foundational practices of shamatha and vipashyana in the first year and explored Yogācāra’s profound psychology of ignorance and awakening in the second, we now turn to the very heart of Tibetan Buddhism: the nature of emptiness and the luminous potential that resides within every living being. Guiding us in this exploration will be core texts from India and Tibet. Nāgārjuna’s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā will serve as a central pillar, systematically dismantling the illusions of inherent existence. In dialogue with this, we’ll study Kamalashīla’s Stages of Meditation, a practical and accessible map for cultivating deep meditative insight grounded in the view of emptiness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Balancing the radical freedom of Madhyamaka, we will encounter the warmth and encouragement of Maitreya’s Ratnagotravibhāga, a poetic illumination of the Buddha-nature within all beings. These teachings remind us that beyond confusion and conditioning, there is a basic goodness that has never been lost. To ground these profound insights in daily life, we will also study the beloved text of Geshe Chekawa Yeshe Dorje, The Seven Points of Mind Training. With its pithy slogans and deeply practical tone, it offers tools for transforming adversity and cultivating bodhicitta on and off the cushion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Throughout the year, our study and practice will be enriched by meditative teachings from both the Pāli and Sanskrit sūtra traditions, inviting a direct and experiential understanding of emptiness — not as a concept, but as a liberating shift in perception. This year is an invitation to let the view of emptiness infuse your practice — not as abstract philosophy, but as living experience: clear, liberating, and rooted in compassion. Our aim is not to gather concepts, but to transform how we see and relate to the world. Through study, reflection, and meditation, we learn to meet life with less grasping, more openness — and a heart that naturally responds with wisdom and care, held by the strength of community.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">The Buddha Project</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This meditation course is part of The Buddha Project led by Ven. Losang Gendun, a branch of which is the Buddha Research Project, an on-going collaboration between Buddhist contemplatives and scientific researchers from the universities of Nîmes and Lausanne, and the Mind &amp; Life organization (founded by neuroscientist Francesco Varela in collaboration with H.H. the Dalai Lama). It is aimed at investigating transformative processes in long-term meditators, regarding such topics as mental health, perception, and self-transcendence. For the initial research it has been granted a European Varela Award.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Introduction to the IDMT training</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Meditation is essential for personal transformation and a crucial complement to Buddhist studies.

If you’re enrolling later on in the course, it is possible to request access to recordings of previous classes. <strong>Practical details</strong> The In-Depth Meditation Training runs weekly on Saturdays and consists of about 1-hour of guided meditation and 1,5 hours of teachings. The course offers a great opportunity for Buddhist practitioners. In the first year many of the foundational topics will be introduced, however a basic understanding of Mahayana Buddhism is a prerequisite to attend. It will be given in English, with French translation, online via Zoom. The recordings will be made available after the sessions.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Practical information and how to register:</strong></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Course dates:</strong> 7 Feb – 18 April</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weekday: </strong>Saturdays</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Time:</strong> 15:30-18:00 European Central Timezone</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Language:</strong> English</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Location:</strong> Online (zoom link will be sent after registration)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Donation:</strong> drop in 250 SEK, term 2500 SEK, 4 times pass 800 SEK</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Last day of registration</strong>: you can join any time</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Your Teacher</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-293321 alignleft\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Venerable-Gendun-round_Web-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />Venerable Losang Gendun has dedicated nearly four decades to practicing Buddhism and has served as a Bhikshu (Buddhist monk) in the Tibetan tradition for the past 18 years. Prior to his ordination, he worked in diverse fields such as palliative care, technology, refugee organizations, and commercial management. His extensive training includes ten years of studying Buddhist philosophy and practice in monasteries across France, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. Additionally, he spent over four years in retreat, immersing himself in Tibetan sutra and tantra, as well as the Burmese Theravada Forest Tradition. For the last 15 years, Ven. Gendun has been a dedicated teacher, sharing his knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, psychology, and meditation worldwide. He serves the aspirations of H.H. the Dalai Lama and Lama Zopa Rinpoche as part of the FPMT (Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition). Ven. Gendun is also a member of Mind &amp; Life Europe, a multidisciplinary laboratory that brings together researchers and contemplative practitioners to explore the nature of experience. Beyond his Buddhist affiliations, Ven. Gendun serves as an interreligious canon at the Peace Cathedral in Tbilisi, Georgia, and feels at home at a Mevlavi Sufi dargah in Istanbul. In 2023, he founded The Buddha Project, which engages in long-term guidance for Buddhist meditators, scientific research, art projects, and intercontemplative social engagement.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Far from abstract philosophy, these teachings offer a radical reorientation of how we perceive ourselves and the world — pointing us beyond habitual grasping to a space of clarity, openness, and profound compassion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Having cultivated the foundational practices of shamatha and vipashyana in the first year and explored Yogācāra’s profound psychology of ignorance and awakening in the second, we now turn to the very heart of Tibetan Buddhism: the nature of emptiness and the luminous potential that resides within every living being. Guiding us in this exploration will be core texts from India and Tibet. Nāgārjuna’s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā will serve as a central pillar, systematically dismantling the illusions of inherent existence. In dialogue with this, we’ll study Kamalashīla’s Stages of Meditation, a practical and accessible map for cultivating deep meditative insight grounded in the view of emptiness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Balancing the radical freedom of Madhyamaka, we will encounter the warmth and encouragement of Maitreya’s Ratnagotravibhāga, a poetic illumination of the Buddha-nature within all beings. These teachings remind us that beyond confusion and conditioning, there is a basic goodness that has never been lost. To ground these profound insights in daily life, we will also study the beloved text of Geshe Chekawa Yeshe Dorje, The Seven Points of Mind Training. With its pithy slogans and deeply practical tone, it offers tools for transforming adversity and cultivating bodhicitta on and off the cushion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Throughout the year, our study and practice will be enriched by meditative teachings from both the Pāli and Sanskrit sūtra traditions, inviting a direct and experiential understanding of emptiness — not as a concept, but as a liberating shift in perception. This year is an invitation to let the view of emptiness infuse your practice — not as abstract philosophy, but as living experience: clear, liberating, and rooted in compassion. Our aim is not to gather concepts, but to transform how we see and relate to the world. Through study, reflection, and meditation, we learn to meet life with less grasping, more openness — and a heart that naturally responds with wisdom and care, held by the strength of community.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">The Buddha Project</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This meditation course is part of The Buddha Project led by Ven. Losang Gendun, a branch of which is the Buddha Research Project, an on-going collaboration between Buddhist contemplatives and scientific researchers from the universities of Nîmes and Lausanne, and the Mind &amp; Life organization (founded by neuroscientist Francesco Varela in collaboration with H.H. the Dalai Lama). It is aimed at investigating transformative processes in long-term meditators, regarding such topics as mental health, perception, and self-transcendence. For the initial research it has been granted a European Varela Award.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Introduction to the IDMT training</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Meditation is essential for personal transformation and a crucial complement to Buddhist studies.

If you’re enrolling later on in the course, it is possible to request access to recordings of previous classes. <strong>Practical details</strong> The In-Depth Meditation Training runs weekly on Saturdays and consists of about 1-hour of guided meditation and 1,5 hours of teachings. The course offers a great opportunity for Buddhist practitioners. In the first year many of the foundational topics will be introduced, however a basic understanding of Mahayana Buddhism is a prerequisite to attend. It will be given in English, with French translation, online via Zoom. The recordings will be made available after the sessions.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Practical information and how to register:</strong></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Course dates:</strong> 7 Feb – 18 April</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weekday: </strong>Saturdays</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Time:</strong> 15:30-18:00 European Central Timezone</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Language:</strong> English</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Location:</strong> Online (zoom link will be sent after registration)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Donation:</strong> drop in 250 SEK, term 2500 SEK, 4 times pass 800 SEK</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Last day of registration</strong>: you can join any time</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Your Teacher</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-293321 alignleft\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Venerable-Gendun-round_Web-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />Venerable Losang Gendun has dedicated nearly four decades to practicing Buddhism and has served as a Bhikshu (Buddhist monk) in the Tibetan tradition for the past 18 years.

His extensive training includes ten years of studying Buddhist philosophy and practice in monasteries across France, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. Additionally, he spent over four years in retreat, immersing himself in Tibetan sutra and tantra, as well as the Burmese Theravada Forest Tradition. For the last 15 years, Ven. Gendun has been a dedicated teacher, sharing his knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, psychology, and meditation worldwide. He serves the aspirations of H.H. the Dalai Lama and Lama Zopa Rinpoche as part of the FPMT (Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition). Ven. Gendun is also a member of Mind &amp; Life Europe, a multidisciplinary laboratory that brings together researchers and contemplative practitioners to explore the nature of experience. Beyond his Buddhist affiliations, Ven. Gendun serves as an interreligious canon at the Peace Cathedral in Tbilisi, Georgia, and feels at home at a Mevlavi Sufi dargah in Istanbul.

Healing of the body and mind is supported by reawakening and balancing our energy. The method was created by the Tibetan lama Tarthang Tulku, primarily to help us who live a hectic life to release stress. By promoting deep relaxation, the conditions are created to naturally deepen meditative concentration and presence. Everyone can participate regardless of age and physical shape, as the exercises can be adapted to suit one&#8217;s own ability.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Course Details</h2>\n<p>🗣️ With Stig Albansson</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">📅 January 18, February 1 and 15, March 1, 15 and 29, April 12 and 19</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🕕 10:00 &#8211; 11:30</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🏠 Online</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px; color: #333333;\">About the Course</span></p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<p>Kum Nye is a gentle method that consists of movement and breathing exercises, self-massage and quiet sitting.

Stig har lett praktikgrupper i Kum Nye på Föreningen för tibetansk buddhism i Göteborg sedan -98, och från 2015 gått flera av de lärarutbildningar i Kum Nye som organiserats av Dharma Publishing. Efter det har ett flertal kurser och retreater getts, bland annat på Yeshin Norbu 2020.

Far from abstract philosophy, these teachings offer a radical reorientation of how we perceive ourselves and the world — pointing us beyond habitual grasping to a space of clarity, openness, and profound compassion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Having cultivated the foundational practices of shamatha and vipashyana in the first year and explored Yogācāra’s profound psychology of ignorance and awakening in the second, we now turn to the very heart of Tibetan Buddhism: the nature of emptiness and the luminous potential that resides within every living being. Guiding us in this exploration will be core texts from India and Tibet. Nāgārjuna’s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā will serve as a central pillar, systematically dismantling the illusions of inherent existence. In dialogue with this, we’ll study Kamalashīla’s Stages of Meditation, a practical and accessible map for cultivating deep meditative insight grounded in the view of emptiness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Balancing the radical freedom of Madhyamaka, we will encounter the warmth and encouragement of Maitreya’s Ratnagotravibhāga, a poetic illumination of the Buddha-nature within all beings. These teachings remind us that beyond confusion and conditioning, there is a basic goodness that has never been lost. To ground these profound insights in daily life, we will also study the beloved text of Geshe Chekawa Yeshe Dorje, The Seven Points of Mind Training. With its pithy slogans and deeply practical tone, it offers tools for transforming adversity and cultivating bodhicitta on and off the cushion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Throughout the year, our study and practice will be enriched by meditative teachings from both the Pāli and Sanskrit sūtra traditions, inviting a direct and experiential understanding of emptiness — not as a concept, but as a liberating shift in perception. This year is an invitation to let the view of emptiness infuse your practice — not as abstract philosophy, but as living experience: clear, liberating, and rooted in compassion. Our aim is not to gather concepts, but to transform how we see and relate to the world. Through study, reflection, and meditation, we learn to meet life with less grasping, more openness — and a heart that naturally responds with wisdom and care, held by the strength of community.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">The Buddha Project</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This meditation course is part of The Buddha Project led by Ven. Losang Gendun, a branch of which is the Buddha Research Project, an on-going collaboration between Buddhist contemplatives and scientific researchers from the universities of Nîmes and Lausanne, and the Mind &amp; Life organization (founded by neuroscientist Francesco Varela in collaboration with H.H. the Dalai Lama). It is aimed at investigating transformative processes in long-term meditators, regarding such topics as mental health, perception, and self-transcendence. For the initial research it has been granted a European Varela Award.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Introduction to the IDMT training</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Meditation is essential for personal transformation and a crucial complement to Buddhist studies.

If you’re enrolling later on in the course, it is possible to request access to recordings of previous classes. <strong>Practical details</strong> The In-Depth Meditation Training runs weekly on Saturdays and consists of about 1-hour of guided meditation and 1,5 hours of teachings. The course offers a great opportunity for Buddhist practitioners. In the first year many of the foundational topics will be introduced, however a basic understanding of Mahayana Buddhism is a prerequisite to attend. It will be given in English, with French translation, online via Zoom. The recordings will be made available after the sessions.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Practical information and how to register:</strong></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Course dates:</strong> 7 Feb – 18 April</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weekday: </strong>Saturdays</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Time:</strong> 15:30-18:00 European Central Timezone</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Language:</strong> English</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Location:</strong> Online (zoom link will be sent after registration)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Donation:</strong> drop in 250 SEK, term 2500 SEK, 4 times pass 800 SEK</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Last day of registration</strong>: you can join any time</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Your Teacher</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-293321 alignleft\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Venerable-Gendun-round_Web-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />Venerable Losang Gendun has dedicated nearly four decades to practicing Buddhism and has served as a Bhikshu (Buddhist monk) in the Tibetan tradition for the past 18 years. Prior to his ordination, he worked in diverse fields such as palliative care, technology, refugee organizations, and commercial management. His extensive training includes ten years of studying Buddhist philosophy and practice in monasteries across France, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. Additionally, he spent over four years in retreat, immersing himself in Tibetan sutra and tantra, as well as the Burmese Theravada Forest Tradition. For the last 15 years, Ven. Gendun has been a dedicated teacher, sharing his knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, psychology, and meditation worldwide. He serves the aspirations of H.H. the Dalai Lama and Lama Zopa Rinpoche as part of the FPMT (Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition). Ven. Gendun is also a member of Mind &amp; Life Europe, a multidisciplinary laboratory that brings together researchers and contemplative practitioners to explore the nature of experience. Beyond his Buddhist affiliations, Ven. Gendun serves as an interreligious canon at the Peace Cathedral in Tbilisi, Georgia, and feels at home at a Mevlavi Sufi dargah in Istanbul. In 2023, he founded The Buddha Project, which engages in long-term guidance for Buddhist meditators, scientific research, art projects, and intercontemplative social engagement.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Far from abstract philosophy, these teachings offer a radical reorientation of how we perceive ourselves and the world — pointing us beyond habitual grasping to a space of clarity, openness, and profound compassion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Having cultivated the foundational practices of shamatha and vipashyana in the first year and explored Yogācāra’s profound psychology of ignorance and awakening in the second, we now turn to the very heart of Tibetan Buddhism: the nature of emptiness and the luminous potential that resides within every living being. Guiding us in this exploration will be core texts from India and Tibet. Nāgārjuna’s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā will serve as a central pillar, systematically dismantling the illusions of inherent existence. In dialogue with this, we’ll study Kamalashīla’s Stages of Meditation, a practical and accessible map for cultivating deep meditative insight grounded in the view of emptiness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Balancing the radical freedom of Madhyamaka, we will encounter the warmth and encouragement of Maitreya’s Ratnagotravibhāga, a poetic illumination of the Buddha-nature within all beings. These teachings remind us that beyond confusion and conditioning, there is a basic goodness that has never been lost. To ground these profound insights in daily life, we will also study the beloved text of Geshe Chekawa Yeshe Dorje, The Seven Points of Mind Training. With its pithy slogans and deeply practical tone, it offers tools for transforming adversity and cultivating bodhicitta on and off the cushion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Throughout the year, our study and practice will be enriched by meditative teachings from both the Pāli and Sanskrit sūtra traditions, inviting a direct and experiential understanding of emptiness — not as a concept, but as a liberating shift in perception. This year is an invitation to let the view of emptiness infuse your practice — not as abstract philosophy, but as living experience: clear, liberating, and rooted in compassion. Our aim is not to gather concepts, but to transform how we see and relate to the world. Through study, reflection, and meditation, we learn to meet life with less grasping, more openness — and a heart that naturally responds with wisdom and care, held by the strength of community.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">The Buddha Project</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This meditation course is part of The Buddha Project led by Ven. Losang Gendun, a branch of which is the Buddha Research Project, an on-going collaboration between Buddhist contemplatives and scientific researchers from the universities of Nîmes and Lausanne, and the Mind &amp; Life organization (founded by neuroscientist Francesco Varela in collaboration with H.H. the Dalai Lama). It is aimed at investigating transformative processes in long-term meditators, regarding such topics as mental health, perception, and self-transcendence. For the initial research it has been granted a European Varela Award.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Introduction to the IDMT training</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Meditation is essential for personal transformation and a crucial complement to Buddhist studies.

If you’re enrolling later on in the course, it is possible to request access to recordings of previous classes. <strong>Practical details</strong> The In-Depth Meditation Training runs weekly on Saturdays and consists of about 1-hour of guided meditation and 1,5 hours of teachings. The course offers a great opportunity for Buddhist practitioners. In the first year many of the foundational topics will be introduced, however a basic understanding of Mahayana Buddhism is a prerequisite to attend. It will be given in English, with French translation, online via Zoom. The recordings will be made available after the sessions.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Practical information and how to register:</strong></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Course dates:</strong> 7 Feb – 18 April</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weekday: </strong>Saturdays</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Time:</strong> 15:30-18:00 European Central Timezone</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Language:</strong> English</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Location:</strong> Online (zoom link will be sent after registration)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Donation:</strong> drop in 250 SEK, term 2500 SEK, 4 times pass 800 SEK</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Last day of registration</strong>: you can join any time</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Your Teacher</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-293321 alignleft\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Venerable-Gendun-round_Web-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />Venerable Losang Gendun has dedicated nearly four decades to practicing Buddhism and has served as a Bhikshu (Buddhist monk) in the Tibetan tradition for the past 18 years. Prior to his ordination, he worked in diverse fields such as palliative care, technology, refugee organizations, and commercial management. His extensive training includes ten years of studying Buddhist philosophy and practice in monasteries across France, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. Additionally, he spent over four years in retreat, immersing himself in Tibetan sutra and tantra, as well as the Burmese Theravada Forest Tradition. For the last 15 years, Ven. Gendun has been a dedicated teacher, sharing his knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, psychology, and meditation worldwide. He serves the aspirations of H.H. the Dalai Lama and Lama Zopa Rinpoche as part of the FPMT (Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition). Ven. Gendun is also a member of Mind &amp; Life Europe, a multidisciplinary laboratory that brings together researchers and contemplative practitioners to explore the nature of experience. Beyond his Buddhist affiliations, Ven. Gendun serves as an interreligious canon at the Peace Cathedral in Tbilisi, Georgia, and feels at home at a Mevlavi Sufi dargah in Istanbul.

Healing of the body and mind is supported by reawakening and balancing our energy. The method was created by the Tibetan lama Tarthang Tulku, primarily to help us who live a hectic life to release stress. By promoting deep relaxation, the conditions are created to naturally deepen meditative concentration and presence. Everyone can participate regardless of age and physical shape, as the exercises can be adapted to suit one&#8217;s own ability.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Course Details</h2>\n<p>🗣️ With Stig Albansson</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">📅 January 18, February 1 and 15, March 1, 15 and 29, April 12 and 19</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🕕 10:00 &#8211; 11:30</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🏠 Online</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px; color: #333333;\">About the Course</span></p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<p>Kum Nye is a gentle method that consists of movement and breathing exercises, self-massage and quiet sitting.

Stig har lett praktikgrupper i Kum Nye på Föreningen för tibetansk buddhism i Göteborg sedan -98, och från 2015 gått flera av de lärarutbildningar i Kum Nye som organiserats av Dharma Publishing. Efter det har ett flertal kurser och retreater getts, bland annat på Yeshin Norbu 2020.

Rooted in the Vajrayāna’s rich lineage, this course explores the foundations of deity yoga, the stages of generation and completion, and the role of guru devotion, mantra, and visualization. We practice tantra not to escape the world, but to transmute it — recognizing all appearances as expressions of enlightened mind.

Far from abstract philosophy, these teachings offer a radical reorientation of how we perceive ourselves and the world — pointing us beyond habitual grasping to a space of clarity, openness, and profound compassion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Having cultivated the foundational practices of shamatha and vipashyana in the first year and explored Yogācāra’s profound psychology of ignorance and awakening in the second, we now turn to the very heart of Tibetan Buddhism: the nature of emptiness and the luminous potential that resides within every living being. Guiding us in this exploration will be core texts from India and Tibet. Nāgārjuna’s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā will serve as a central pillar, systematically dismantling the illusions of inherent existence. In dialogue with this, we’ll study Kamalashīla’s Stages of Meditation, a practical and accessible map for cultivating deep meditative insight grounded in the view of emptiness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Balancing the radical freedom of Madhyamaka, we will encounter the warmth and encouragement of Maitreya’s Ratnagotravibhāga, a poetic illumination of the Buddha-nature within all beings. These teachings remind us that beyond confusion and conditioning, there is a basic goodness that has never been lost. To ground these profound insights in daily life, we will also study the beloved text of Geshe Chekawa Yeshe Dorje, The Seven Points of Mind Training. With its pithy slogans and deeply practical tone, it offers tools for transforming adversity and cultivating bodhicitta on and off the cushion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Throughout the year, our study and practice will be enriched by meditative teachings from both the Pāli and Sanskrit sūtra traditions, inviting a direct and experiential understanding of emptiness — not as a concept, but as a liberating shift in perception. This year is an invitation to let the view of emptiness infuse your practice — not as abstract philosophy, but as living experience: clear, liberating, and rooted in compassion. Our aim is not to gather concepts, but to transform how we see and relate to the world. Through study, reflection, and meditation, we learn to meet life with less grasping, more openness — and a heart that naturally responds with wisdom and care, held by the strength of community.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">The Buddha Project</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This meditation course is part of The Buddha Project led by Ven. Losang Gendun, a branch of which is the Buddha Research Project, an on-going collaboration between Buddhist contemplatives and scientific researchers from the universities of Nîmes and Lausanne, and the Mind &amp; Life organization (founded by neuroscientist Francesco Varela in collaboration with H.H. the Dalai Lama). It is aimed at investigating transformative processes in long-term meditators, regarding such topics as mental health, perception, and self-transcendence. For the initial research it has been granted a European Varela Award.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Introduction to the IDMT training</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Meditation is essential for personal transformation and a crucial complement to Buddhist studies.

If you’re enrolling later on in the course, it is possible to request access to recordings of previous classes. <strong>Practical details</strong> The In-Depth Meditation Training runs weekly on Saturdays and consists of about 1-hour of guided meditation and 1,5 hours of teachings. The course offers a great opportunity for Buddhist practitioners. In the first year many of the foundational topics will be introduced, however a basic understanding of Mahayana Buddhism is a prerequisite to attend. It will be given in English, with French translation, online via Zoom. The recordings will be made available after the sessions.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Practical information and how to register:</strong></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Course dates:</strong> 7 Feb – 18 April</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weekday: </strong>Saturdays</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Time:</strong> 15:30-18:00 European Central Timezone</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Language:</strong> English</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Location:</strong> Online (zoom link will be sent after registration)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Donation:</strong> drop in 250 SEK, term 2500 SEK, 4 times pass 800 SEK</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Last day of registration</strong>: you can join any time</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Your Teacher</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-293321 alignleft\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Venerable-Gendun-round_Web-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />Venerable Losang Gendun has dedicated nearly four decades to practicing Buddhism and has served as a Bhikshu (Buddhist monk) in the Tibetan tradition for the past 18 years. Prior to his ordination, he worked in diverse fields such as palliative care, technology, refugee organizations, and commercial management. His extensive training includes ten years of studying Buddhist philosophy and practice in monasteries across France, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. Additionally, he spent over four years in retreat, immersing himself in Tibetan sutra and tantra, as well as the Burmese Theravada Forest Tradition. For the last 15 years, Ven. Gendun has been a dedicated teacher, sharing his knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, psychology, and meditation worldwide. He serves the aspirations of H.H. the Dalai Lama and Lama Zopa Rinpoche as part of the FPMT (Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition). Ven. Gendun is also a member of Mind &amp; Life Europe, a multidisciplinary laboratory that brings together researchers and contemplative practitioners to explore the nature of experience. Beyond his Buddhist affiliations, Ven. Gendun serves as an interreligious canon at the Peace Cathedral in Tbilisi, Georgia, and feels at home at a Mevlavi Sufi dargah in Istanbul. In 2023, he founded The Buddha Project, which engages in long-term guidance for Buddhist meditators, scientific research, art projects, and intercontemplative social engagement.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Far from abstract philosophy, these teachings offer a radical reorientation of how we perceive ourselves and the world — pointing us beyond habitual grasping to a space of clarity, openness, and profound compassion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Having cultivated the foundational practices of shamatha and vipashyana in the first year and explored Yogācāra’s profound psychology of ignorance and awakening in the second, we now turn to the very heart of Tibetan Buddhism: the nature of emptiness and the luminous potential that resides within every living being. Guiding us in this exploration will be core texts from India and Tibet. Nāgārjuna’s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā will serve as a central pillar, systematically dismantling the illusions of inherent existence. In dialogue with this, we’ll study Kamalashīla’s Stages of Meditation, a practical and accessible map for cultivating deep meditative insight grounded in the view of emptiness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Balancing the radical freedom of Madhyamaka, we will encounter the warmth and encouragement of Maitreya’s Ratnagotravibhāga, a poetic illumination of the Buddha-nature within all beings. These teachings remind us that beyond confusion and conditioning, there is a basic goodness that has never been lost. To ground these profound insights in daily life, we will also study the beloved text of Geshe Chekawa Yeshe Dorje, The Seven Points of Mind Training. With its pithy slogans and deeply practical tone, it offers tools for transforming adversity and cultivating bodhicitta on and off the cushion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Throughout the year, our study and practice will be enriched by meditative teachings from both the Pāli and Sanskrit sūtra traditions, inviting a direct and experiential understanding of emptiness — not as a concept, but as a liberating shift in perception. This year is an invitation to let the view of emptiness infuse your practice — not as abstract philosophy, but as living experience: clear, liberating, and rooted in compassion. Our aim is not to gather concepts, but to transform how we see and relate to the world. Through study, reflection, and meditation, we learn to meet life with less grasping, more openness — and a heart that naturally responds with wisdom and care, held by the strength of community.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">The Buddha Project</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This meditation course is part of The Buddha Project led by Ven. Losang Gendun, a branch of which is the Buddha Research Project, an on-going collaboration between Buddhist contemplatives and scientific researchers from the universities of Nîmes and Lausanne, and the Mind &amp; Life organization (founded by neuroscientist Francesco Varela in collaboration with H.H. the Dalai Lama). It is aimed at investigating transformative processes in long-term meditators, regarding such topics as mental health, perception, and self-transcendence.

Prior to his ordination, he worked in diverse fields such as palliative care, technology, refugee organizations, and commercial management. His extensive training includes ten years of studying Buddhist philosophy and practice in monasteries across France, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. Additionally, he spent over four years in retreat, immersing himself in Tibetan sutra and tantra, as well as the Burmese Theravada Forest Tradition. For the last 15 years, Ven. Gendun has been a dedicated teacher, sharing his knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, psychology, and meditation worldwide. He serves the aspirations of H.H. the Dalai Lama and Lama Zopa Rinpoche as part of the FPMT (Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition). Ven. Gendun is also a member of Mind &amp; Life Europe, a multidisciplinary laboratory that brings together researchers and contemplative practitioners to explore the nature of experience. Beyond his Buddhist affiliations, Ven. Gendun serves as an interreligious canon at the Peace Cathedral in Tbilisi, Georgia, and feels at home at a Mevlavi Sufi dargah in Istanbul.

    "description": "<div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h1 style=\"color: #333333; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Kum Nye Course Online</h1>\n<p>Kum Nye is a gentle method that consists of movement and breathing exercises, self-massage and quiet sitting. Healing of the body and mind is supported by reawakening and balancing our energy. The method was created by the Tibetan lama Tarthang Tulku, primarily to help us who live a hectic life to release stress. By promoting deep relaxation, the conditions are created to naturally deepen meditative concentration and presence. Everyone can participate regardless of age and physical shape, as the exercises can be adapted to suit one&#8217;s own ability.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Course Details</h2>\n<p>🗣️ With Stig Albansson</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">📅 January 18, February 1 and 15, March 1, 15 and 29, April 12 and 19</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🕕 10:00 &#8211; 11:30</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🏠 Online</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px; color: #333333;\">About the Course</span></p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<p>Kum Nye is a gentle method that consists of movement and breathing exercises, self-massage and quiet sitting. Healing of the body and mind is supported by reawakening and balancing our inner energies. The method was created by the Tibetan lama Tarthang Tulku, primarily to help us who live a hectic life to release stress. In this course of eight sessions, experienced Kum Nye practitioner and teacher Stig Albansson will guide you through practices from the book Kum Nye Tibetan Yoga by Tartang Tulku, that can then be practiced the weeks between each session.</p>\n<p>The book is available for sale from Yeshin Norbu, if you are interested to purchase a copy please reach out to: <span style=\"color: #ff9900;\">hello@yeshinnorbu.se</span>.</p>\n</div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-293658\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kum-Nye-Tibetan-Yoga-Book-191x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"191\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-293666\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/KumNye-tumnaglar-online-05-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"428\" height=\"241\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px; color: #333333;\">About the Teacher</span></p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Stig Albansson mötte Kum Nye under en 6 månaders kurs/retreat på Nyingma Institute i Berkeley i Kalifornien, 1996-97. Stig har lett praktikgrupper i Kum Nye på Föreningen för tibetansk buddhism i Göteborg sedan -98, och från 2015 gått flera av de lärarutbildningar i Kum Nye som organiserats av Dharma Publishing. Efter det har ett flertal kurser och retreater getts, bland annat på Yeshin Norbu 2020. Från 2017 har också mycket undervisning erbjudits online, och sedan januari i år håller Stig i Kum Nye tre morgnar i veckan via Zoom.</span></p>\n</div>",

One does not need to be a Buddhist to join this course; it&#8217;s suitable for those students who are relatively new to buddhism and would like to gain a better understanding of the entire Buddhist path and also for more experienced students who wish to refresh their understanding of the stages of the path to enlightenment.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px;\">Course Details</span></h1>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<p>🗣️ With Venerable Khadro</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">📅 Thursdays 16, 23 April &amp; Thursdays 7, 14, 21 May</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🕕 6:00 &#8211; 8:00 PM CET</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🏠 Hybrid (in person at Yeshin Norbu/Stockholm and on zoom; recordings will be rent to participants)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">About This Course</h2>\n<p>In this course you will gain a clear idea of the path to enlightenment, especially its three main components: renunciation, Bodhichitta, and the right view of emptiness. You will understand the progressive, step-like structure of the Buddhist path (Lam Rim), its origin in the teachings of Guru Shakyamuni Buddha, the three scopes, where you fit at your present stage of spiritual development, what you need to do next, and how you get from there to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>The stages of the path to enlightenment (lamrim in Tibetan) are Shakyamuni Buddha’s original teachings presented as a logical and gradual system for learning to develop the mind. Arranged in Tibet by Lama Atisha in the eleventh century, the lamrim was subsequently elaborated by other great Tibetan, notably Lama Tsongkhapa during the fourteenth century.</p>\n<p>Understanding the structure and qualities of these stages is like having a road map for transforming life’s challenges and progressing step by step toward happiness, liberation, and enlightenment. In this module, we will study an overview of the path, including seminal texts, such as the Three Principal Aspects of the Path, and The Foundation of all Good Qualities.</p>\n<p>This is the third in a series of 14 modules covering the complete Buddhist path to enlightenment. Students may join at any point in the cycle. Discovering Buddhism is designed for students who wish to deepen their understanding of fundamental Buddhist concepts. The program is designed to provide an experiential taste of the Buddha’s teachings and the skills we need to make our lives most meaningful. Each module includes teachings, meditations, readings, and assessment questions. A short retreat is offered at the end of the course.</p>\n<p>*Nobody should be turned away from studying Dharma due to financial reasons. If the suggested course contribution feels too much for you, please let us know (spc@yeshinnorbu.se) and we&#8217;ll see how we can help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px; align-items: start;\">\n<div style=\"flex: 0 0 15%;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 50%; aspect-ratio: 1/1; object-fit: cover;\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Venerable-Khadro_portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Venerable Khadro\" /></div>\n<div style=\"flex: 1;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Your Teacher</h2>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Venerable Khadro brings years of experience teaching Buddhist philosophy and meditation in the tradition of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

Far from abstract philosophy, these teachings offer a radical reorientation of how we perceive ourselves and the world — pointing us beyond habitual grasping to a space of clarity, openness, and profound compassion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Having cultivated the foundational practices of shamatha and vipashyana in the first year and explored Yogācāra’s profound psychology of ignorance and awakening in the second, we now turn to the very heart of Tibetan Buddhism: the nature of emptiness and the luminous potential that resides within every living being. Guiding us in this exploration will be core texts from India and Tibet. Nāgārjuna’s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā will serve as a central pillar, systematically dismantling the illusions of inherent existence. In dialogue with this, we’ll study Kamalashīla’s Stages of Meditation, a practical and accessible map for cultivating deep meditative insight grounded in the view of emptiness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Balancing the radical freedom of Madhyamaka, we will encounter the warmth and encouragement of Maitreya’s Ratnagotravibhāga, a poetic illumination of the Buddha-nature within all beings. These teachings remind us that beyond confusion and conditioning, there is a basic goodness that has never been lost. To ground these profound insights in daily life, we will also study the beloved text of Geshe Chekawa Yeshe Dorje, The Seven Points of Mind Training. With its pithy slogans and deeply practical tone, it offers tools for transforming adversity and cultivating bodhicitta on and off the cushion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Throughout the year, our study and practice will be enriched by meditative teachings from both the Pāli and Sanskrit sūtra traditions, inviting a direct and experiential understanding of emptiness — not as a concept, but as a liberating shift in perception. This year is an invitation to let the view of emptiness infuse your practice — not as abstract philosophy, but as living experience: clear, liberating, and rooted in compassion. Our aim is not to gather concepts, but to transform how we see and relate to the world. Through study, reflection, and meditation, we learn to meet life with less grasping, more openness — and a heart that naturally responds with wisdom and care, held by the strength of community.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">The Buddha Project</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This meditation course is part of The Buddha Project led by Ven. Losang Gendun, a branch of which is the Buddha Research Project, an on-going collaboration between Buddhist contemplatives and scientific researchers from the universities of Nîmes and Lausanne, and the Mind &amp; Life organization (founded by neuroscientist Francesco Varela in collaboration with H.H. the Dalai Lama). It is aimed at investigating transformative processes in long-term meditators, regarding such topics as mental health, perception, and self-transcendence. For the initial research it has been granted a European Varela Award.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Introduction to the IDMT training</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Meditation is essential for personal transformation and a crucial complement to Buddhist studies.

If you’re enrolling later on in the course, it is possible to request access to recordings of previous classes. <strong>Practical details</strong> The In-Depth Meditation Training runs weekly on Saturdays and consists of about 1-hour of guided meditation and 1,5 hours of teachings. The course offers a great opportunity for Buddhist practitioners. In the first year many of the foundational topics will be introduced, however a basic understanding of Mahayana Buddhism is a prerequisite to attend. It will be given in English, with French translation, online via Zoom. The recordings will be made available after the sessions.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Practical information and how to register:</strong></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Course dates:</strong> 7 Feb – 18 April</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weekday: </strong>Saturdays</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Time:</strong> 15:30-18:00 European Central Timezone</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Language:</strong> English</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Location:</strong> Online (zoom link will be sent after registration)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Donation:</strong> drop in 250 SEK, term 2500 SEK, 4 times pass 800 SEK</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Last day of registration</strong>: you can join any time</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Your Teacher</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-293321 alignleft\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Venerable-Gendun-round_Web-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />Venerable Losang Gendun has dedicated nearly four decades to practicing Buddhism and has served as a Bhikshu (Buddhist monk) in the Tibetan tradition for the past 18 years. Prior to his ordination, he worked in diverse fields such as palliative care, technology, refugee organizations, and commercial management. His extensive training includes ten years of studying Buddhist philosophy and practice in monasteries across France, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. Additionally, he spent over four years in retreat, immersing himself in Tibetan sutra and tantra, as well as the Burmese Theravada Forest Tradition. For the last 15 years, Ven. Gendun has been a dedicated teacher, sharing his knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, psychology, and meditation worldwide. He serves the aspirations of H.H. the Dalai Lama and Lama Zopa Rinpoche as part of the FPMT (Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition). Ven. Gendun is also a member of Mind &amp; Life Europe, a multidisciplinary laboratory that brings together researchers and contemplative practitioners to explore the nature of experience. Beyond his Buddhist affiliations, Ven. Gendun serves as an interreligious canon at the Peace Cathedral in Tbilisi, Georgia, and feels at home at a Mevlavi Sufi dargah in Istanbul.

Healing of the body and mind is supported by reawakening and balancing our energy. The method was created by the Tibetan lama Tarthang Tulku, primarily to help us who live a hectic life to release stress. By promoting deep relaxation, the conditions are created to naturally deepen meditative concentration and presence. Everyone can participate regardless of age and physical shape, as the exercises can be adapted to suit one&#8217;s own ability.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Course Details</h2>\n<p>🗣️ With Stig Albansson</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">📅 January 18, February 1 and 15, March 1, 15 and 29, April 12 and 19</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🕕 10:00 &#8211; 11:30</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🏠 Online</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px; color: #333333;\">About the Course</span></p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<p>Kum Nye is a gentle method that consists of movement and breathing exercises, self-massage and quiet sitting.

Stig har lett praktikgrupper i Kum Nye på Föreningen för tibetansk buddhism i Göteborg sedan -98, och från 2015 gått flera av de lärarutbildningar i Kum Nye som organiserats av Dharma Publishing. Efter det har ett flertal kurser och retreater getts, bland annat på Yeshin Norbu 2020. Från 2017 har också mycket undervisning erbjudits online, och sedan januari i år håller Stig i Kum Nye tre morgnar i veckan via Zoom.</span></p>\n</div>",

Rooted in the Vajrayāna’s rich lineage, this course explores the foundations of deity yoga, the stages of generation and completion, and the role of guru devotion, mantra, and visualization. We practice tantra not to escape the world, but to transmute it — recognizing all appearances as expressions of enlightened mind. It is a path of fearless compassion, unshakable clarity, and skillful means. This course is intended for those who have studied the Lam Rim, are already grounded in the sutra path and ready to deepen their understanding of Vajrayāna’s profound methods.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">In the event of any enquiries please reach out to <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"mailto:spc@yeshinnorbu.se\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">spc@yeshinnorbu.se</span></a></span>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px; align-items: start;\">\n<div style=\"flex: 0 0 15%;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 50%; aspect-ratio: 1/1; object-fit: cover;\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Venerable-Khadro_portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Venerable Khadro\" /></div>\n<div style=\"flex: 1;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Your Teacher</h2>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Venerable Khadro brings years of experience teaching Buddhist philosophy and meditation in the tradition of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

One does not need to be a Buddhist to join this course; it&#8217;s suitable for those students who are relatively new to buddhism and would like to gain a better understanding of the entire Buddhist path and also for more experienced students who wish to refresh their understanding of the stages of the path to enlightenment.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px;\">Course Details</span></h1>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<p>🗣️ With Venerable Khadro</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">📅 Thursdays 16, 23 April &amp; Thursdays 7, 14, 21 May</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🕕 6:00 &#8211; 8:00 PM CET</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🏠 Hybrid (in person at Yeshin Norbu/Stockholm and on zoom; recordings will be rent to participants)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">About This Course</h2>\n<p>In this course you will gain a clear idea of the path to enlightenment, especially its three main components: renunciation, Bodhichitta, and the right view of emptiness. You will understand the progressive, step-like structure of the Buddhist path (Lam Rim), its origin in the teachings of Guru Shakyamuni Buddha, the three scopes, where you fit at your present stage of spiritual development, what you need to do next, and how you get from there to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>The stages of the path to enlightenment (lamrim in Tibetan) are Shakyamuni Buddha’s original teachings presented as a logical and gradual system for learning to develop the mind. Arranged in Tibet by Lama Atisha in the eleventh century, the lamrim was subsequently elaborated by other great Tibetan, notably Lama Tsongkhapa during the fourteenth century.</p>\n<p>Understanding the structure and qualities of these stages is like having a road map for transforming life’s challenges and progressing step by step toward happiness, liberation, and enlightenment. In this module, we will study an overview of the path, including seminal texts, such as the Three Principal Aspects of the Path, and The Foundation of all Good Qualities.</p>\n<p>This is the third in a series of 14 modules covering the complete Buddhist path to enlightenment. Students may join at any point in the cycle. Discovering Buddhism is designed for students who wish to deepen their understanding of fundamental Buddhist concepts. The program is designed to provide an experiential taste of the Buddha’s teachings and the skills we need to make our lives most meaningful. Each module includes teachings, meditations, readings, and assessment questions. A short retreat is offered at the end of the course.</p>\n<p>*Nobody should be turned away from studying Dharma due to financial reasons.

Rooted in the Vajrayāna’s rich lineage, this course explores the foundations of deity yoga, the stages of generation and completion, and the role of guru devotion, mantra, and visualization. We practice tantra not to escape the world, but to transmute it — recognizing all appearances as expressions of enlightened mind. It is a path of fearless compassion, unshakable clarity, and skillful means. This course is intended for those who have studied the Lam Rim, are already grounded in the sutra path and ready to deepen their understanding of Vajrayāna’s profound methods.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">In the event of any enquiries please reach out to <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"mailto:spc@yeshinnorbu.se\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">spc@yeshinnorbu.se</span></a></span>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px; align-items: start;\">\n<div style=\"flex: 0 0 15%;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 50%; aspect-ratio: 1/1; object-fit: cover;\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Venerable-Khadro_portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Venerable Khadro\" /></div>\n<div style=\"flex: 1;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Your Teacher</h2>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Venerable Khadro brings years of experience teaching Buddhist philosophy and meditation in the tradition of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

One does not need to be a Buddhist to join this course; it&#8217;s suitable for those students who are relatively new to buddhism and would like to gain a better understanding of the entire Buddhist path and also for more experienced students who wish to refresh their understanding of the stages of the path to enlightenment.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px;\">Course Details</span></h1>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<p>🗣️ With Venerable Khadro</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">📅 Thursdays 16, 23 April &amp; Thursdays 7, 14, 21 May</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🕕 6:00 &#8211; 8:00 PM CET</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🏠 Hybrid (in person at Yeshin Norbu/Stockholm and on zoom; recordings will be rent to participants)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">About This Course</h2>\n<p>In this course you will gain a clear idea of the path to enlightenment, especially its three main components: renunciation, Bodhichitta, and the right view of emptiness. You will understand the progressive, step-like structure of the Buddhist path (Lam Rim), its origin in the teachings of Guru Shakyamuni Buddha, the three scopes, where you fit at your present stage of spiritual development, what you need to do next, and how you get from there to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>The stages of the path to enlightenment (lamrim in Tibetan) are Shakyamuni Buddha’s original teachings presented as a logical and gradual system for learning to develop the mind. Arranged in Tibet by Lama Atisha in the eleventh century, the lamrim was subsequently elaborated by other great Tibetan, notably Lama Tsongkhapa during the fourteenth century.</p>\n<p>Understanding the structure and qualities of these stages is like having a road map for transforming life’s challenges and progressing step by step toward happiness, liberation, and enlightenment. In this module, we will study an overview of the path, including seminal texts, such as the Three Principal Aspects of the Path, and The Foundation of all Good Qualities.</p>\n<p>This is the third in a series of 14 modules covering the complete Buddhist path to enlightenment. Students may join at any point in the cycle. Discovering Buddhism is designed for students who wish to deepen their understanding of fundamental Buddhist concepts. The program is designed to provide an experiential taste of the Buddha’s teachings and the skills we need to make our lives most meaningful. Each module includes teachings, meditations, readings, and assessment questions. A short retreat is offered at the end of the course.</p>\n<p>*Nobody should be turned away from studying Dharma due to financial reasons.

Rooted in the Vajrayāna’s rich lineage, this course explores the foundations of deity yoga, the stages of generation and completion, and the role of guru devotion, mantra, and visualization. We practice tantra not to escape the world, but to transmute it — recognizing all appearances as expressions of enlightened mind.

One does not need to be a Buddhist to join this course; it&#8217;s suitable for those students who are relatively new to buddhism and would like to gain a better understanding of the entire Buddhist path and also for more experienced students who wish to refresh their understanding of the stages of the path to enlightenment.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px;\">Course Details</span></h1>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<p>🗣️ With Venerable Khadro</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">📅 Thursdays 16, 23 April &amp; Thursdays 7, 14, 21 May</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🕕 6:00 &#8211; 8:00 PM CET</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🏠 Hybrid (in person at Yeshin Norbu/Stockholm and on zoom; recordings will be rent to participants)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">About This Course</h2>\n<p>In this course you will gain a clear idea of the path to enlightenment, especially its three main components: renunciation, Bodhichitta, and the right view of emptiness. You will understand the progressive, step-like structure of the Buddhist path (Lam Rim), its origin in the teachings of Guru Shakyamuni Buddha, the three scopes, where you fit at your present stage of spiritual development, what you need to do next, and how you get from there to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>The stages of the path to enlightenment (lamrim in Tibetan) are Shakyamuni Buddha’s original teachings presented as a logical and gradual system for learning to develop the mind. Arranged in Tibet by Lama Atisha in the eleventh century, the lamrim was subsequently elaborated by other great Tibetan, notably Lama Tsongkhapa during the fourteenth century.</p>\n<p>Understanding the structure and qualities of these stages is like having a road map for transforming life’s challenges and progressing step by step toward happiness, liberation, and enlightenment. In this module, we will study an overview of the path, including seminal texts, such as the Three Principal Aspects of the Path, and The Foundation of all Good Qualities.</p>\n<p>This is the third in a series of 14 modules covering the complete Buddhist path to enlightenment. Students may join at any point in the cycle. Discovering Buddhism is designed for students who wish to deepen their understanding of fundamental Buddhist concepts. The program is designed to provide an experiential taste of the Buddha’s teachings and the skills we need to make our lives most meaningful. Each module includes teachings, meditations, readings, and assessment questions. A short retreat is offered at the end of the course.</p>\n<p>*Nobody should be turned away from studying Dharma due to financial reasons.

One does not need to be a Buddhist to join this course; it&#8217;s suitable for those students who are relatively new to buddhism and would like to gain a better understanding of the entire Buddhist path and also for more experienced students who wish to refresh their understanding of the stages of the path to enlightenment.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px;\">Course Details</span></h1>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<p>🗣️ With Venerable Khadro</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">📅 Thursdays 16, 23 April &amp; Thursdays 7, 14, 21 May</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🕕 6:00 &#8211; 8:00 PM CET</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">🏠 Hybrid (in person at Yeshin Norbu/Stockholm and on zoom; recordings will be rent to participants)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">About This Course</h2>\n<p>In this course you will gain a clear idea of the path to enlightenment, especially its three main components: renunciation, Bodhichitta, and the right view of emptiness. You will understand the progressive, step-like structure of the Buddhist path (Lam Rim), its origin in the teachings of Guru Shakyamuni Buddha, the three scopes, where you fit at your present stage of spiritual development, what you need to do next, and how you get from there to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>The stages of the path to enlightenment (lamrim in Tibetan) are Shakyamuni Buddha’s original teachings presented as a logical and gradual system for learning to develop the mind. Arranged in Tibet by Lama Atisha in the eleventh century, the lamrim was subsequently elaborated by other great Tibetan, notably Lama Tsongkhapa during the fourteenth century.</p>\n<p>Understanding the structure and qualities of these stages is like having a road map for transforming life’s challenges and progressing step by step toward happiness, liberation, and enlightenment. In this module, we will study an overview of the path, including seminal texts, such as the Three Principal Aspects of the Path, and The Foundation of all Good Qualities.</p>\n<p>This is the third in a series of 14 modules covering the complete Buddhist path to enlightenment. Students may join at any point in the cycle. Discovering Buddhism is designed for students who wish to deepen their understanding of fundamental Buddhist concepts. The program is designed to provide an experiential taste of the Buddha’s teachings and the skills we need to make our lives most meaningful. Each module includes teachings, meditations, readings, and assessment questions. A short retreat is offered at the end of the course.</p>\n<p>*Nobody should be turned away from studying Dharma due to financial reasons. If the suggested course contribution feels too much for you, please let us know (spc@yeshinnorbu.se) and we&#8217;ll see how we can help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px; align-items: start;\">\n<div style=\"flex: 0 0 15%;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 50%; aspect-ratio: 1/1; object-fit: cover;\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Venerable-Khadro_portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Venerable Khadro\" /></div>\n<div style=\"flex: 1;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Your Teacher</h2>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Venerable Khadro brings years of experience teaching Buddhist philosophy and meditation in the tradition of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

Rooted in the Vajrayāna’s rich lineage, this course explores the foundations of deity yoga, the stages of generation and completion, and the role of guru devotion, mantra, and visualization. We practice tantra not to escape the world, but to transmute it — recognizing all appearances as expressions of enlightened mind. It is a path of fearless compassion, unshakable clarity, and skillful means. This course is intended for those who have studied the Lam Rim, are already grounded in the sutra path and ready to deepen their understanding of Vajrayāna’s profound methods.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">In the event of any enquiries please reach out to <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"mailto:spc@yeshinnorbu.se\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">spc@yeshinnorbu.se</span></a></span>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px; align-items: start;\">\n<div style=\"flex: 0 0 15%;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 50%; aspect-ratio: 1/1; object-fit: cover;\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Venerable-Khadro_portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Venerable Khadro\" /></div>\n<div style=\"flex: 1;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Your Teacher</h2>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Venerable Khadro brings years of experience teaching Buddhist philosophy and meditation in the tradition of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

Rooted in the Vajrayāna’s rich lineage, this course explores the foundations of deity yoga, the stages of generation and completion, and the role of guru devotion, mantra, and visualization. We practice tantra not to escape the world, but to transmute it — recognizing all appearances as expressions of enlightened mind.

    "description": "<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Welcome to this kids and pets friendly whole day event!</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Last year we did the practice of animal liberation with Venerable Michael and a few members of Yeshin Norbu sangha at the <a href=\"https://tibetanbuddhism.se/stupan-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stupa in Fellingsbro</a>. This Buddhist stupa that was built in the 80s and was consecrated by His Holiness the Dalai Lama during one of His Holiness&#8217; visits.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What is animal liberation practice? </strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Animal liberation is one of the heart practices of Lama Zopa Rinpoche. Whenever possible, Rinpoche rescues animals like goats which are on the way to the slaughter house. Such animals are sent to the animal sanctuary afterwards. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkZDAVI2gxY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rinpoche liberates even small insects</a>.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Lama Zopa Rinpoche recommends animal liberation as a specific practice done for animals who would otherwise be killed, such as livestock, bait worms, and live feeder insects. The practice involves taking the endangered animals around holy objects, reciting mantras for them, blessing water to sprinkle onto their bodies, and then releasing them. Rinpoche teaches that the practice benefits animal spiritually and is an incredible practice for anyone who is ill or experiencing life obstacles. Animal blessings, on the other hand, involve blessing animals with mantras or holy objects, even if they are not in danger.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Also, practices of animal liberation are done for the long lives of our teachers.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">You can read more here:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:embed -->\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-fpmt wp-block-embed-fpmt\">\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">https://fpmt.org/education/prayers-and-practice-materials/benefiting-animals-practices-and-advice/</div></figure>\r\n<!-- /wp:embed --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">When one does animal liberation, one circumambulates holy objects and recites mantras for the rescued beings. Animal liberation is not only about saving animals from the immediate threat, but also giving them Dharma. In that way one practices love &#8211; freeing from fear and generosity of Dharma.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Last year we liberated a few hundreds worms which were supposed to be used as fish bait. We will do the same this year.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><strong>If you wish to donate for purchasing worms to be saved, you can make a donation below. </strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>You can take your pets with you to circumambulate the stupa. </strong>In that way you can help them purify their negative karma by going around the stupa.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>On Saturday May 18th </strong>we will go to Fellingsbro, 2-2,5 hours drive from Stockholm. We will do the practice and then have a potluck picnic there. Please bring vegan dishes. If you plan to go from Stockholm and have a car, please let us know by email to hello@yeshinnorbu by May 16th, and we can help organize a car-pooling.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nPlease also email us your dedications if you cannot go, we will read the names in the end of the practice and dedicate for them.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nIt is a whole day event.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

We practice tantra not to escape the world, but to transmute it — recognizing all appearances as expressions of enlightened mind. It is a path of fearless compassion, unshakable clarity, and skillful means. This course is intended for those who have studied the Lam Rim, are already grounded in the sutra path and ready to deepen their understanding of Vajrayāna’s profound methods.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">In the event of any enquiries please reach out to <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"mailto:spc@yeshinnorbu.se\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">spc@yeshinnorbu.se</span></a></span>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px; align-items: start;\">\n<div style=\"flex: 0 0 15%;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 50%; aspect-ratio: 1/1; object-fit: cover;\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Venerable-Khadro_portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Venerable Khadro\" /></div>\n<div style=\"flex: 1;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Your Teacher</h2>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Venerable Khadro brings years of experience teaching Buddhist philosophy and meditation in the tradition of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

This practice illuminates the darkness of delusion and easily destroys the infinite negativity preventing our spiritual development. This retreat gives an opportunity to deepen the practice and understanding over a number of days leading into summer. The technique of Calm Abiding also known as Shamatha, enables us to develop a peaceful, focused, and clear mind. These two meditations can improve health, remove anxiety and bring a clearer perspective on life and on relationships.</p>\n<p>This retreat will provide methods for transforming difficulties, achieving serenity and resilience, and finding satisfaction and meaning.</p>\n<p>We live in a busy, speedy world where there is so much to do and so much coming at us. Taking time out from one’s daily routine and stepping back from one’s day-to-day responsibilities to work with one’s mind can be very beneficial. One great benefit of practicing in retreat is that there are no distractions, allowing you to truly be with yourself. Simplifying your days clarifies the mind. You can focus on your inner landscape, on this one breath, on this one step.</p>\n<p>This retreat is suitable for beginners as well as for those who are already familiar with meditation and wish to deepen and enrich their practice. By the end of the retreat, you will have the tools necessary to continue and expand your daily meditation practice.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'fedra sans book'; font-size: 26px;\">Retreat Schedule</span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<p><strong>Fri 12th  to Wed 17th</strong><br />\n9.00 to 10.30am ~ Morning Practice, Blessing the Speech &amp; Prostrations<br />\n10.30am ~ Break<br />\n10.40am ~ Vajrasattva Session<br />\n12.10pm ~ Break<br />\n12.20pm ~ Calm Abiding Session<br />\n1pm ~ Lunch<br />\n2.30 to 3.00pm ~ Water bowls karma yoga (in alternating pairs)<br />\n3.00 to 4.30pm ~ Vajrasattva Session<br />\n4.30pm ~ Break<br />\n4.45 to 6.00pm ~ Calm Abiding Session &amp; Dedication prayers</p>\n<p><strong>Thu 18th</strong><br />\n9.00 to 10.30am ~ Morning Practice, Blessing the Speech &amp; Prostrations<br />\n10.30am ~ Break<br />\n10.40am ~ Vajrasattva Session<br />\n12.10pm ~ Break<br />\n12.20pm ~ Extensive dedication prayers<br />\n1pm ~ End of retreat</p>\n<p><strong>Silence</strong><br />\nWill be kept during the mornings</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px; align-items: start;\">\n<div style=\"flex: 0 0 15%;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 50%; aspect-ratio: 1/1; object-fit: cover;\" src=\"https://yeshinnorbu.se/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Venerable-Khadro_portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Venerable Khadro\" /></div>\n<div style=\"flex: 1;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; margin-top: 0; font-family: 'fedra sans book';\">Your Teacher</h2>\n<p style=\"color: #333333;\">Venerable Khadro brings years of experience teaching Buddhist philosophy and meditation in the tradition of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.
