# Railway auto-deploys from GitHub when connected via Railway dashboard.
# This workflow exists as a placeholder and will be replaced once
# RAILWAY_TOKEN (an API token from railway.com/account/tokens) is
# added as a GitHub secret.
#
# To fix: go to https://railway.com/account/tokens → create token →
# add as RAILWAY_TOKEN in https://github.com/craigrallen/yeshe-norbu/settings/secrets
